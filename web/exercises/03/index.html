## Overview
**This exercise is to be completed with a partner**

Your github repository should be called *game615-spring2023-03*


## Description
For this exercise, you will create a small game where the player controls some a 3d model that needs to collect one object, and avoid another. For example, a rocket ship might try to collect fuel and avoid asteroids. Or a person might try to "eat" (collect) a sandwich and avoid a bee or something. 

Something unique must happen when the player collides with each type of object. For example, perhaps the person might grow larger when they collide with the sandwich, and might move slower when they collide with the bee.

Finally, your partner and you should challenge yourself to make the game have a win and lose conditions (i.e. a goal). How you choose to design and implement that is up to you, but try to only make use of the sort of thing we have covered in class already. One example might be that the player only has a certain amount of time to collect all of the desirable objects or they are destroyed. Or perhaps the player is always moving forward, but their fuel is constantly depleting, and there is collectable fuel everywhere. The goal of the game might be to survive (not run out of fuel) for a certain amount of time. As a simple thing to try, perhaps you can just say the player wins if they collect a certain number of the good items.

### Implementation Requirements and Tips
- Create a prefab for each type of object, and assign them each a unique tag
- The player and each type of object should make use of an object hierarchy to ensure that the pivot of the object if located at the bottom of it, and that the 3d model is facing down the parent object's z (blue) axis
- The player and each object should be a 3d model from [poly.pizza](poly.pizza)
- In order to create an effect for collisions with each type of object you should make use of the "CompareTag" function inside of the OnTriggerEnter function (see the example's "PlayerController.cs" for an example of checking to see if the player collided with a coin)
- See the example from exercise02 to see an example of how you can use a float variable and Time.deltaTime to figure out how much time has passed.
- Try your best with the goal thing, but I realize we haven't really covered enough to communicate that a goal has been met (i.e. no on screen text yet), so it is OK if you just track win/lose conditions in the code.
