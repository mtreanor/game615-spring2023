START MARKDOWN DESCRIPTION

*The purpose of this midterm is to assess both your knowledge of the basics of Unity and your ability to Github to host your code and a playable version of a small game. The midterm is to be completed and submitted during class on Wednesday, March 8th. As with the exercises, there are very particular instructions for how to submit your work. Please read them carefully.*

## Description
Create a small game that demonstrates your understanding of the basics of using Unity. Try your best to demonstrate as many of the following competencies as you have time for:
1. Responding to player input
1. Having objects move around
1. Writing to code to respond to when certain objects collide
1. Displaying dynamic information on the screen
1. Using the Unity Hierarchy to configure game object's pivot and forward vector
1. Creating prefabs via code

See below for details on how to submit your project files and playable version of your game via Github. 

If you have errors and can't build your project, still submit the project via GitHub, but also include a screenshot of the errors in the Console within Unity. Feel free to include any other screenshots you think might be helpful in demonstrating your knowledge.

      <h2 class="mt-6">Configuring your project</h2>
      <p>Name your repository "game615-spring2023-midterm"</p>
      <p>Make sure to <a href="../../setup.html">set your Unity and Github projects correctly.</a> <b>BE EXTRA REALLY SUPER CERTAIN THAT YOUR GITIGNORE FILE IS CONFIGURED CORRECTLY AND PLACED IN YOUR UNITY PROJECT FOLDER (the same one as assets)</b></p>
    </div>


    <div class="container pb-5">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Building your Project for the Web</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open the Build Settings (File > Build Settings...)</li>
          <li>Click the Add Open Scenes button</li>
          <li>Select "WebGL" and then click the "Switch Platform" button</li>
          <li>Remember to <a href="../../setup.html">modify your player settings</a> (disable compression, turn off auto WebGL graphics or whatever if necessary.)</li>
          <li>Click the "Build" button</li>
          <li>
            When it asks you where you want to put your build, create a folder titled "play" in your main repository folder ("game615-spring2023-midterm").
            Once you do this, it will take several minutes to build your game, and then you can commit and push your build. After five or so minutes it should be playable at:

            http://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/game615-spring2023-midterm/play
          </li>
