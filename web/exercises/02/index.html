      <h2 class="mt-6">Description</h2>
      <p>Name your Unity project "exercise02".</p>
      <p>
        Modify the sample code to make something more interesting! We don't know
        <i>too much</i> yet, so really challenge yourself to make something
        compelling out of what we've covered so far.
        <ul>
          <li>Arranging shapes to knock eachother over</li>
          <li>Launching things to knowck things over</li>
          <li>Using custom colors</li>
          <li>Change the colors of things that crash into eachother</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Carefully read through the code
        and try to follow how it works as best as you can. Please email me about
        office hours if you want any additional explainations. The main
        file you should look at is:
        <ul>
          <li>PlayerController.cs</li>
        </ul>
        You can ignore most of the other files. NOTE: The '.meta' files are used
        by Unity, and while necessary to make the game run, are not intended for
        developers to read.

      <h2 class="mt-6">Getting the Sample Project Loaded into Your Project</h2>
      <p>
        To integrate the project into another Unity project, download and import the .unitypackage file located at the "CODE" link below.
        In your own Unity project, go to Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you do this, all of the assets from the sample project will be loaded
        into your project. Double click the "scene" file (the one with the Unity logo)
        to actually open up the sample game.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container pb-5">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Building your Project for the Web</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open the Build Settings (File > Build Settings...)</li>
          <li>Click the Add Open Scenes button</li>
          <li>Select "WebGL" and then click the "Switch Platform" button</li>
          <li>Modify your player settings as you did for exercise01 (disable compression, turn off auto WebGL graphics or whatever if necessary.)</li>
          <li>Click the "Build" button</li>
          <li>
            When it asks you where you want to put your build, create a folder titled "play" in your exercise02 folder.
            Once you do this, it will take several minutes to build your game.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-6">Submission</h2>
      <p>
        Turn in this assignment via your GitHub repository for this class. Each submission must be accompanied by a README.md file that contains your name, the name of any collaborators you had, and a link to a playable version of your game (i.e. a WebGL build). Also, on collaborations, only one member of the team should have the project in their repository and the rest of the team should be Contributors.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        Also, as part of your submission process, you must complete <a href="https://forms.gle/gB3P7C6hzg5f9n3k8">this form evaluation of your team members</a>.
