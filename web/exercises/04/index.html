## Description
Create a very basic flight simulator where the player attempts to collect objects spread around the sky. The number of items that have been collected should be displayed on the screen. To create a simple simulation of flight, your "plane" should simply move forward and rotate using the arrow keys. In addition to the plane movement and collection, you need to **complete at least two of the following challenges**. *Make note of which challenges you completed inside of your README.md file.*

### Challenges
- Display a timer on the screen. If the player fails to collect all the collectable items before it reaches zero, destroy the player and display a "You Lose" message of some sort.
- Make it so the plane can create and launch items forward towards some target (i.e. it can shoot stuff). Something should happen when the launched item collides with the other object (e.g. score should increase or something).
- Make the plane always be slowing down, and have the speed pick up when it collides with one of the collectable items. This can be done by making the speed variable always be decreasing a small amount in Update, and then increase it when the player collides with the item.
- Enhance the realism by making it so the plane increases in speed when facing downwards and decreases when facing upward. Hint: how much the plane is facing up or down can be determined by the y value of the forward vector.
- Make it so the plane will crash if it runs into anything other than the collectable items. When the plane crashes, it should return to its starting position.

### NOTE
- I've found that the Rotate function should be called with the "Space.self" option, and the Translate function should be called with the "Space.world" function. See the example to see this in action.

      <h2 class="mt-6">Submission</h2>
      <p>
        Turn in this assignment via your properly named GitHub repository. <b>Each submission must be accompanied by a README.md file</b> that contains your name, the name of your collaborators, and a <a href="https://anvilproject.org/guides/content/creating-links">link to a playable version of your game</a> (i.e. a WebGL build). Also include any other information you think may be relevant (e.g. how to play if it isn't obvious). Also, don't forget to note which challenges you completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, as part of your submission process, you must complete <a href="https://forms.gle/gB3P7C6hzg5f9n3k8">this form</a>. In the form there is a place to link your repository - this is where I will look to see your submission.
